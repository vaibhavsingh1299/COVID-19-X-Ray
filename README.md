# COVID-19-X-Ray
In this project, I have used a ResNet-18 model in PyTorch and trained it on a COVID-19 Radiography dataset from Kaggle. This dataset has nearly 3000 Chest X-Ray scans which have been categorized into three classes - Normal, Viral Pneumonia and COVID-19. The objective of this project is to create an image classification model that can predict Chest X-Ray scans that belong to one of the three classes with reasonably high accuracy. This project made use of Python and my theoretical understanding of Convolutional Neural Networks, and optimization techniques such as gradient descent.
